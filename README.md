# 🔍 Reverse Engineering Open Source Issues

Welcome to the **Reverse-Engineered Issue Workflow** — a hands-on project designed to help students and new contributors learn how to analyze, recreate, and fix closed issues from real-world open source repositories.

This repo contains:

- ✅ A structured 5-step reverse-engineering process
- 📄 Log templates for pre- and post-fix documentation
- 🧠 Reflection and skill-tracking guidance
- 🛠️ Tools for mentor/instructor verification

---

## 📚 Purpose

This project is built to:

- Demystify how open source fixes are made
- Help students learn by rebuilding fixes from scratch
- Reinforce Git/GitHub workflows (branching, tagging, diffing)
- Encourage deeper reading of code, PRs, and file changes
- Teach reproducible, reflective coding practices

## 🧭 Project Workflow Overview

Each issue you reverse-engineer should follow the 5 documented steps:

| **Step** | **Summary** |
| --- | --- |
| [Step 1](Step%201%20Select%20and%20Prep.md) | Select and prepare an issue + PR to reverse-engineer |
| [Step 2](Step%202%20Study%20the%20Issue.md) | Study the original PR and tag the broken state |
| [Step 3](Step%203%20Apply%20the%20Fix.md) | Recreate and manually fix the issue yourself |
| [Step 4](Step%204%20Wrap%20it%20Up.md) | Compare your fix to the original and document your work |
| [Step 5](Step%205%20Reflect%20and%20Learn.md) | Reflect on what you learned and how you grew |

See individual Markdown files in the `/steps` directory for details.

## 📝 Documentation Templates

All work should be paired with:

- 📌 `RE Issue Pre-Fix Log` — created in Step 2
- 🛠 `RE Issue Post-Fix Log` — completed in Step 4

Templates are provided in the `/templates/` directory.

## ✅ Requirements for Each Reverse-Engineered Issue

1. Use **a clean Git branch** for your fix
2. **Tag the broken state** before you begin your changes:
    
    ```
    git tag broken-version-#####
    ```
    
3. **Log your process** using both templates
4. **Compare your fix** to the original PR using:
    
    ```
    git diff broken-version-#####..your-branch-name
    ```
    
5. Submit your full documentation with all logs and branch references

## 🧠 Sample Issue Walkthrough (Optional)

To view a complete example, see the `/Sample_Issue_Walkthrough` directory (if present). This includes:

- A real issue and PR from freeCodeCamp
- A pre-fix log and post-fix log
- The diff between the broken and fixed branches
- Reflections and lessons learned
