# Re-authenticate GitHub Inside GitPod

## First Step

Use the following link to update permissions for Gitpod:

https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-use-gitpod-in-the-curriculum/668669#update-your-permissions-on-gitpod-20

## ✅ Next Try: Using GitHub CLI (`gh`)

In your GitPod terminal:

```bash
gh auth login
```

If you get the error: “bash: gh: command not found”, or something similar, go to second try.

- Select **GitHub.com**
- Choose **HTTPS**
- Say **Yes** to authenticate with a browser
- It will give you a login URL and one-time code
- Open it in GitPod’s browser (you can paste it directly into your GitPod preview tab)
- Paste in the code, authorize

Once done, GitPod can **push to your repo without 403s**.

## ✅ Finally, Try: Manual Authentication w/ Personal Access Token

Since `gh` isn't available, here’s a fallback method that works every time:

### ✅ 1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):**

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings → Tokens (Classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **“Generate new token” → “Classic”**
3. Give it a name like `GitPod Push Access`
4. Select scopes:
    - ✅ `repo` (you need this for pushing)
    - (Optionally `workflow` if you want CI control later)
5. Generate and **copy the token** right away — you won't see it again!

---

### ✅ 2. **Set Your Credentials in GitPod**

Back in your GitPod terminal, run:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Then try pushing again:

```bash
git push origin uptodate-state
```

You'll be prompted to enter:

- Username → **your GitHub username**
- Password → **your PAT (paste it in)**

It will store it for the session and future pushes.

---

### ✅ 3. Confirm It’s Working

After that push works, you’re fully authenticated — no more 403 errors, and your tags/branches will go through!

> 💡 Tip: You only need to do this once per GitPod workspace. If it restarts, you may need to re-authenticate.
