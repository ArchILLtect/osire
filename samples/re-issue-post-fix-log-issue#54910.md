# RE Issue Post-Fix Log (#54910)

## 📌 Project: freeCodeCamp

## 📅 Fix Completed: April 18, 2025

---

## 🔧 Fix Implementation Overview:

- **Branch Used:** `issue-54910-fixed`
- **Fix Type:** Content/Textual Consistency
- **Strategy:** Manually updated each affected `.md` file by locating the incorrect phrase `"an src"` and replacing it with `"a src"` for consistency.
- **Goal:** Match article usage with how “src” is pronounced (“source”), not phonetically spelled (“ess-are-see”).

---

## 🧰 Steps Taken:

1. ✅ Created and checked out a branch:
    
    `git checkout -b issue-54910-fixed`
    
2. 🔎 Located all instances of `"an src"` across the relevant files using:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    grep -rnw './curriculum/challenges/english' -e 'an src'
    
    ```
    
3. 📝 Edited each listed `.md` file to:
    - Change `an src` → `a src`
    - Ensure no surrounding sentence structure was affected
4. 💻 Saved and committed changes:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix(curriculum): standardize article usage to 'a src'"
    
    ```
    
5. 🧪 Manually verified file renderings in Gitpod to ensure syntax, spacing, and logic were unaffected.

## 🔁 Notes on the Process:

- 🧠 This fix reinforced the importance of **maintaining consistency across learning materials**.
- 💡 Searching with `grep` or GitHub's code search made finding affected files fast and precise.
- ✅ The fix required **zero code changes**—just content adjustments—but still passed the usual PR checklist and made a meaningful impact.

## 🧠 Reflections:

- ⚖️ The PR looked tiny, but it spanned multiple files and concepts, showing how even *small fixes can ripple across a large repo.*
- 🎯 Making consistent changes across multiple files without accidentally breaking syntax felt like good training in precision editing.
- 📚 This fix now serves as a “model PR” I can reference when making future text-based fixes or documentation edits.
