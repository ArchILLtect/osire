## üîç Description of Issue:

The curriculum had inconsistent article usage ‚Äî switching between "a src attribute" and "an src attribute." The inconsistency occurred across multiple challenge descriptions.

---

## üß† Understanding the Fix:

All instances of "an src" were changed to "a src" for consistency. This follows the logic that "src" is pronounced "source" (not "ess-are-see"), so it takes "a".
