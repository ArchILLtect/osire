## 🧠 Hypothesis

Before looking at the fix:

- **How do you think it was solved?**
    
    > Likely by manually locating and replacing incorrect articles using find/replace in relevant curriculum files.
    > 
- **What code files or areas do you think are affected?**
    
    > Likely markdown or JSON lesson files in the `curriculum` directory, particularly English language files.
    > 
- **If you were fixing it, what would your approach be?**
    
    > I would search for all uses of "a" followed by a vowel-starting word and verify whether it should be changed to "an." Possibly use a regex pattern or linter if one exists.
