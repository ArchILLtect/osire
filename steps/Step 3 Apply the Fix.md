# Step 3: Apply the Fix

# 🛠 Step 3: Apply the Fix

Here’s your mission breakdown:

---

### 1. 🔄 **Recreate the Bug**

Before you fix it, make sure you *can* recreate it:

- Clone the repo if you haven’t already
- Checkout the commit or branch *before* the PR was merged
- Navigate to one of the files containing the issue
- Confirm that the issue still exists exactly as described

---

### 2. 🧰 **Apply Your Own Fix**

Manually fix the issue yourself:

- **First, attempt to fix the bug in your own way** (based on your understanding of the issue)
- **If unsure or stuck, refer back to the original PR’s fix** for hints
—Otherwise, if attempt would take too long—
- Make the same grammatical correction you saw in the original PR
- Double-check your version matches the fixed version in the PR (but *don’t copy-paste!* Reproduce based on your understanding)

### 3. 🔍 **Test or Preview (if applicable)**

- If it’s a Markdown or content fix (like in this issue), use a markdown preview tool or run the app locally to check your change
- Double-check that your fix addresses the original problem
- Confirm that the fix visually or functionally looks good
- Verify you didn’t accidentally break anything else nearby

### 4. 📝 **Document Your Process**

Update your **Post-Fix Log** with:

- The exact change(s) you made
- Any notes on why you made them
- How you confirmed the fix worked
- Any differences between your approach and the original PR, if applicable

🔁 Compare what you actually did here to your original hypothesis from Step 1. Did it go as expected? What surprised you?
