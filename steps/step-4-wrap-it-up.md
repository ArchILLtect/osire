## üõ† Step 4: Submit Your Reverse-Engineered Fix

Here‚Äôs your mission breakdown:

---

### 1. üì¶ **Stage, Commit, and Push Your Changes**

After you've successfully applied and tested your fix:

- **Stage your changes:**
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    
- **Commit your changes with a clear message:**
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Reverse-engineered fix for [issue#]: [short description of fix]"
    ```
    
    > üí° Tip: Keep commit messages short but descriptive, e.g., "Reverse-engineered fix for #54910: corrected article usage"
    > 
- **Push your branch to your GitHub fork:**
    
    ```bash
    git push origin reverse-fix-[issue#]
    ```

### 2. üîÄ **Compare to the Original PR**

- Review your branch‚Äôs changes compared to the original PR (the one you reverse-engineered).
- Look for:
    - ‚úÖ Did you solve the same problem?
    - ‚úÖ Did you avoid unnecessary changes?
    - ‚úÖ Did you use clean, readable code or formatting?
- If your approach is different, briefly note why in your documentation (this shows critical thinking! üß†)

> ‚Äúüí° You can also run the following Git command to compare your work to the original broken version directly:
> 

```bash
git diff broken-version-[issue#]..reverse-fix-[issue#]
```

### 3. üìù **Complete the Post-Fix Log**

Update your RE Issue Post-Fix Log Template with:

- What you changed
- How it fixed the issue
- Whether you solved it differently or identically
- How you tested or verified your fix
