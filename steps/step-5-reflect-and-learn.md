# Step 5: Reflect and Learn

# 🛠 Step 5: Reflect and Learn

Here’s your mission breakdown:

---

### 1. 🧠 **Reflect on the Process**

Answer these questions honestly:

- Look back at your Step 1 hypothesis and Step 2 summary. Did your understanding of the issue hold up? Did you solve it the way you thought you would?
- What was the **most challenging** part of reverse-engineering this fix?
- What was **easier than expected**?
- Did you **learn something new** (about Git, reading code, the repo structure, markdown, or something else)?
- Was there anything you **would do differently** if you tackled a bigger or harder issue?

> 💡 Tip: You’re not just reporting — you’re demonstrating growth. Even struggles are wins if you show what you learned from them.

### 2. ✏️ **Summarize Key Skills Practiced**

Create a short bullet list of technical and soft skills you used:

Example:

- ✅ Git branching and tagging
- ✅ Reading and understanding pull requests
- ✅ Debugging issues based on commit history
- ✅ Applying fixes without direct copy-paste
- ✅ Documenting work clearly for others

---

### 3. 🚀 **State Your Next Steps**

End your reflection with a note about what you want to do next:

Example:

> “Next, I plan to tackle a slightly more complex issue that involves multiple files or functions. I also want to practice creating pull requests to contribute to open-source projects."
> 

(Or whatever your real next goal is — show you’re thinking *forward*.)
